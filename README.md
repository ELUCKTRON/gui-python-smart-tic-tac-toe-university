# 🎮 Smart Tic-Tac-Toe — Python GUI Edition

A classic 3×3 Tic-Tac-Toe game with a modern twist!

- 🎓 **University project** for Semester 3 Python course

## 🤖 What is a "Rule-Based Bot"?

This isn't AI in the machine learning sense.  
Our bot uses **predefined decision rules**, like:

- "Take the center if it's free"
- "Block the opponent if they're about to win"
- "Go for the win if possible"
- "Prioritize corners over sides"

The result? It plays **like a strategist**, without needing training or models. Smart, simple, and effective.
